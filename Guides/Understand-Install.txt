Installing on Linux & Solaris
=============================

#Installation Instructions

#Uncompress and extract the contents of the installation file. For example:

    % tar -xvzf Understand-4.0.800-Linux-64bit.tgz

#This will extract Understand. The executable is located in the bin directory.

  % cd scitools/bin/linux64
  % ./understand

##Add to PATH

#The PATH variable should be updated for each user, either in a
#system-specific location or individually by each user. Add the appropriate bin directory to the path e.g.:

  % export PATH=$PATH:/path/scitools/bin/linux64

###Add STIHOME variable for C API use

#If youâ€™re planning on using the C API, add the STIHOME variable to your environment as well. It should point to the
#directory where Understand is installed. e.g:

  % export STIHOME=/path/scitools
